# Ellucian Mobile Auto-login Web

This module will enable the Ellucian Mobile apps to auto-login on specific webpages.
It is a kind of faux single sign on. When you login to the mobile app,
your username and password are stored in accessible variables that can be
access and injected into any web form to simulate a single sign on.

This is more of proof of concept and you should really just implement CAS or SAML.
